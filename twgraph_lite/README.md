Installation:
* Copy the twgraph_lite folder into your moodle installation under the report folder

Configuration:
* By default, users are all able to view their own graphs, but only 'managers' (in the system context) can 'view others graphs'
* If you desire teachers to be able to see student's graphs, then please understand that this will show them grades from other courses
* To enable teachers to view student's graphs, use the 'course creator' role (or define a new system role) and enable the permissions within there.
